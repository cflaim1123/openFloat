## Project description
This project aims to quantify haloclines in Colvos Passage Puget Sound, WA, by building a DIY profiling float that costs ~$500 to manufacture. Traditional autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) cost ~$100,000 or more. We hope to obtain high-quality data using traditional AUV deployment and propulsion methods with a DIY AUV.
